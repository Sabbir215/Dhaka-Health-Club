# 🎯 FIXED: Dashboard Not Showing Users

## The Problem

Dashboard showed "No community members yet" even though 2 users existed in the database.

## Root Cause

**Firestore Security Rules** were too restrictive!

### Previous Rules (WRONG ❌):

```javascript
match /users/{userId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
}
```

This only allowed users to read **their own** profile, not other users' profiles.

### Updated Rules (CORRECT ✅):

```javascript
match /users/{userId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null;  // Any authenticated user can read all profiles
  allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;  // Only modify your own
}
```

## What Changed

1. ✅ **Read access**: Any authenticated user can now read all user profiles
2. ✅ **Write access**: Users can still only modify their own data (security maintained)
3. ✅ **Dashboard stats**: Added rules to allow reading dashboard collection
4. ✅ **Tasks**: Added rules for tasks collection

## Solution Deployed

```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

The new security rules have been deployed to Firebase!

## Test It Now

1. Refresh your dashboard at `http://localhost:4324/dashboard`
2. You should now see all 2 users displayed with:
   - Profile pictures or gradient avatars
   - Full names and emails
   - Latest contribution information

## Console Output

You should now see in the browser console (F12):

```
📢 Users collection updated! Total members: 2
📊 User documents: [
  { id: "...", fullName: "...", email: "..." },
  { id: "...", fullName: "...", email: "..." }
]
```

---

**Status**: ✅ FIXED - Users will now display on the dashboard!
